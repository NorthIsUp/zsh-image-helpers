# NAME: HAMMING 
# 
# PURPOSE: To compute the percent hamming distance between two binary string perceptual hashes.
# 
# DESCRIPTION: HAMMING computes the percent hamming distance between two binary string 
# perceptual hashes. The two hashes strings may be privided directly or they may be 
# extracted from two input images in which one or more has hashes have been stored 
# for one of several hash methods. The potential hash methods that may be stored in 
# the images are as follows: 
# 
# Block Mean Hash (bmh): The preprocess image is scale to 16x16 pixels, which is the 
# same as averaging non-overlapping blocks of 16x16 pixels. The hash is computed by 
# comparing the global mean of the 256x256 image to each of the 16x16 pixel value. If  
# the value is larger than the global mean, the hash is set to 1; otherwise 0. This  
# forms a 256 length binary string for the hash.
#
# Block Difference Hash (bdh): The preprocessed image is scale to 9x8 pixels. Then each 
# pixel is subtracted from its neighbor to the right, thresholded at 0 and divided by 
# 255. This forms a 128 length binary string. The preprocessed image is scale again,  
# but this time to 8x9 pixels. Then each pixel is subtracted from its neighbor below, 
# thresholded at 0 and divided by 255. This forms another 128 length binary string. 
# Finally the two 128 length strings are appended to form a 256 length string for 
# the binary hash.
# 
# Annular Variance Hash (avh): The preprocessed image is converted to 256x256 polar 
# format with the columns representing angles and the rows representing radius. Thus 
# each row is an annulus (circular ring) of the preprocessed image. The variance of 
# each row is computed to get the variance as a function of radius as a list of 256 
# values. Each value is compared to the next one. If the next one is larger, then a 
# value of 1 is assigned; othewise a value of 0 is assigned. This produces a 255 length 
# binary string for the hash.
# 
# Polar FFT Hash (pfh): The preprocessed image is converted to 256x256 polar format 
# with the columns representing angles and the rows representing radius. The FFT 
# magnitude is then computed and the center 15x15 pixels are extracted and listed 
# as 225 graylevel values in row first order. Each pixel's graylevel is then compared 
# to the next one. If the next one is larger, then a value of 1 is assigned; othewise 
# a value of 0 is assigned. This produces a 224 length binary string for the hash.

# OPTIONS: 
#
# -p1 phash1 ... PHASH1 is the optional first perceptual hash to compare to the 
# second perceptual hash. The hash is a binary string of values. The number of binary 
# digits in the string must match that of the second perceptual hash. Using PHASH1 and 
# PHASH2 takes precedence over perceptual hashes provided in two optional input images.
# Infiles do not need to be provided if both phash1 and phash2 are provided.
# 
# -p2 phash2 ... PHASH21 is the optional second perceptual hash to compare to the 
# first perceptual hash. The hash is a binary string of values. The number of binary 
# digits in the string must match that of the second perceptual hash. Using PHASH1 and 
# PHASH2 takes precedence over perceptual hashes provided in two optional input images.
# Infiles do not need to be provided if both phash1 and phash2 are provided.
# 
# -s source ... SOURCE location in in the two infiles' meta date to retrieve the 
# perceptual hash values. The choices are: the "comment" (c) or "label" (l) fields in 
# the images' meta data. The default=comment.
# 
# -m method ... METHOD identifies which perceptual hash value to retrieve from the 
# two images' meta data fields. More than one hash may be stored in the meta data field, 
# but only one may be specified for computing the hamming distance. The choices are:
# bmh (block mean hash), bdh (block difference hash), avh (annular variance hash), 
# pfh (polar fft hash). The default=bmh.
#
# CAVEAT: No guarantee that this script will work on all platforms, 
# nor that trapping of inconsistent parameters is complete and 
# foolproof. Use At Your Own Risk.
